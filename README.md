# EyeExercise
The mouse movement event is used to update the position of two "eye" elements displayed in a window that follow the mouse's cursor position on the screen using the mouse events.

Move the mouse around the windows and note how the eyeballs track with the mouse cursor location in real-time.

Roadmap of Future Improvements

Enhance the eyes with eyelids that blink randomly; Provide the capability to "cross" the eyes
